# CaesarCipher

## Description
This program enables a user to encrypt information that they enter on the command line.
The user can also get their original information back.
The user has to use specific key so as to encrypt or decrypt the information logged in the command line.

## Setup and installation
You can `git clone ` the code  and improve it by using other modes of encryption.
You will need `IntelliJ` to code since it is the best Java environment and it has plugins automatically added.
